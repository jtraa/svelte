Tutorial Svelte

Description.
A rating application which gives you the count of the reviews and the average of the rating score. You can also add your own rating text with rating score plus delete other ratings.

Svelte.
I used VueJS before but I think Svelte is less complicated than Vue or React is, so I think I am gonna be using Svelte a lot more.
